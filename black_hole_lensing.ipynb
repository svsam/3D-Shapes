        "## Introduction\n",
        "We model a non-rotating (Schwarzschild) black hole and trace bundles of light rays passing nearby. The physical system includes the black hole, near-parallel incoming light rays, and the strong gravitational field that bends those rays into curved trajectories, creating a gravitational lensing effect. Some rays are deflected and escape, while others cross the event horizon and are lost.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the modeling approach, we use a 2D planar approximation with an effective gravitational bending model. The code compares a Newtonian corpuscular bending model (treating light like fast particles under an inverse-square force) to a GR-inspired bending model (by amplifying the Newtonian acceleration to approximate the stronger deflection predicted by general relativity). This is not a full null-geodesic solver, but it captures the qualitative lensing behavior with a simplified differential-equation integration.\n",
        "\n",
        "A note on accretion disk visibility is included because many visualizations of black holes show bright rings or disks. We add an optional disk radius for context and to emphasize that lensing can make parts of the disk visible even when they would normally be hidden behind the black hole. The disk itself is not simulated as radiating material here; it is a visual reference for interpreting ray paths.\n"
